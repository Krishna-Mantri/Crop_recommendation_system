# Crop Recommendation System

## About
This project is a **Crop Recommendation System** that uses machine learning to recommend the most suitable crop to cultivate based on environmental and soil parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH value, and rainfall.

## Key Features
- Predicts best crop based on soil nutrient values and climatic conditions.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms trained on agricultural datasets.
- Easy-to-use input interface for parameters affecting crop yield.
- Helps farmers make informed decisions to maximize agricultural productivity.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Primary language)
- Machine Learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
- Data Preprocessing and Model Training

## Installation
1. Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/Krishna-Mantri/Crop_recommendation_system.git

   cd Crop_recommendation_system

2. Install required dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
1. Prepare the input parameters such as soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
2. Run the main script or application to get crop recommendations.  
Example:  
python app.py

3. Follow the on-screen prompts or use the web interface to input values and receive crop recommendations.

## Dataset
The system typically uses datasets containing columns like:  
- Nitrogen (N)  
- Phosphorus (P)  
- Potassium (K)  
- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- pH  
- Rainfall  
- Crop label (target variable)
